.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pop3p
is POP3 gateway service to allow internal users to access external POP3
servers.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -I
Inetd mode. Standalone service only.
.TP
.B -d
Daemonise. Detach service from console and run in the background.
.TP
.B -t
Be silenT. Do not log start/stop/accept error records.
.TP
.B -u
Never look for username authentication.
.TP
.B -e
External address. IP address of interface proxy should initiate connections
from. 
By default system will deside which address to use in accordance
with routing table.
.TP
.B -i
Internal address. IP address proxy accepts connections to.
By default connection to any interface is accepted. It\'s usually unsafe.
.TP
.B -p
Port. Port proxy listens for incoming connections. Default is 110.
.TP
.B -h
Default destination. It's used if targed address is not specified by user.
.TP
.B -l
Log. By default logging is to stdout. If
.I logfile
is specified logging is to file. Under Unix, if
.RI \' @ \'
preceeds
.IR logfile ,
syslog is used for logging.
.TP
.B -S
Increase or decrease stack size. You may want to try something like -S8192 if you experience 3proxy
crashes.
.SH CLIENTS
You can use any MUA (Mail User Agent) with POP3 support. Set client to use
.I internal_ip
and
.IR port
as a POP3 server. Address of real POP3 server must be configured as a part of
POP3 username. Format for username is
.IR username \fB@ server ,
where
.I server
is address of POP3 server and
.I username
is user\'s login on this POP3 server. Login itself may contain \'@\' sign.
Only cleartext authentication is supported, because challenge-response
authentication (APOP, CRAM-MD5, etc) requires challenge from server before
we know which server to connect.
