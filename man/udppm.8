.B udppm
\- UDP port mapper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "pop3p " [ -ds ]
.IB \fR[ -l \fR[ \fR[ @ \fR] logfile \fR]]
.IB \fR[ -i internal_ip\fR]
.IB \fR[ -e external_ip\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B udppm
forwards datagrams from local to remote UDP port
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -I
Inetd mode. Standalone service only.
.TP
.B -d
Daemonise. Detach service from console and run in the background.
.TP
.B -t
Be silenT. Do not log start/stop/accept error records.
.TP
.B -e
External address. IP address of interface proxy should initiate datagrams
from. 
By default system will deside which address to use in accordance
with routing table.
.TP
.B -i
Internal address. IP address proxy accepts datagrams to.
By default connection to any interface is accepted. It\'s usually unsafe.
.TP
.B -l
Log. By default logging is to stdout. If
.I logfile
is specified logging is to file. Under Unix, if
.RI \' @ \'
preceeds
.IR logfile ,
syslog is used for logging.
.TP
.B -s
Single packet. By default only one client can use udppm service, but
if -s is specified only one packet will be forwarded between client and server.
It allows to share service between multiple clients for single packet services
(for example name lookups).
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I local_port
- port udppm accepts datagrams
.TP
.I remote_host
- IP address of the host datagrams are forwarded to
.TP
.I remote_port
- remote port datagrams are forwarded to
.SH CLIENTS
Any UDP based application can be used as a client. Use
.I internal_ip
and
.I local_port
as a destination in client application. All datagrams are forwarded to
.IR remote_host : remote_port
