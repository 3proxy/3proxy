.SH DESCRIPTION
.B proxy
is SNI gateway service (destination host is taken from TLS handshake). Destination port must be specified via -P option (or it may be detected with Transparent plugin).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -I
Inetd mode. Standalone service only.
.TP
.B -d
Daemonise. Detach service from console and run in the background.
.TP
.B -t
Be silenT. Do not log start/stop/accept error records.
.TP
.B -u
Never ask for username authentication
.TP
.B -e
External address. IP address of interface proxy should initiate connections
from. 
By default system will deside which address to use in accordance
with routing table.
.TP
.B -i
Internal address. IP address proxy accepts connections to.
By default connection to any interface is accepted. It\'s usually unsafe.
.TP
.B -a
Anonymous. Hide information about client.
.TP
.B -a1
Anonymous. Show fake information about client.
.TP
.B -p
listening_port. Port proxy listens for incoming connections. Default is 1443.
.TP
.B -P
destination_port. Port to establish outgoing connections. One is required unless Transparent plugin is not used because TLS handshake does not contain port information. Default is 443.
.TP
.B -c
TLS_CHECK_LEVEL. 0 (default) - allow non-TLS traffic to pass, 1 - require TLS, only check client HELLO packet, 2 - require TLS, check both client and server HELLO, 3 - require TLS, check server send certificate (not compatible with TLS 1.3), 4 - require mutual TLS, check server send certificate request and client sends certificate (not compatible with TLS 1.3)
.TP
.B -l
Log. By default logging is to stdout. If
.I logfile
is specified logging is to file. Under Unix, if
.RI \' @ \'
preceeds
.IR logfile ,
syslog is used for logging.
.TP
.B -S
Increase or decrease stack size. You may want to try something like -S8192 if you experience 3proxy
crashes.
.SH CLIENTS
You should use client with HTTP proxy support or configure router to redirect
HTTP traffic to proxy (transparent proxy). Configure client to connect to
.I internal_ip
and
.IR port .
HTTPS support allows to use almost any TCP based protocol. If you need to
limit clients, use 
.BR 3proxy (8)
instead.
