auth iponly
#auth nbname
#auth strong
# auth specifies type of user authentication. If you specify none proxy
# will not do anything to check name of the user. If you specify
# nbname proxy will send NetBIOS name request packet to UDP/137 of
# client and parse request for NetBIOS name of messanger service.
# Strong means that proxy will check password. For strong authentication
# unknown user will not be allowed to use proxy regardless of ACL.
# If you do not want username to be checked but wanna ACL to work you should
# specify auth iponly.

#allow * 192.168.1.0/24 * 25,53,110,20-21,1024-65535
# we will allow everything if username matches ADMINISTRATOR or root or
# client ip is 127.0.0.1 or 192.168.1.1. Overwise we will redirect any request
# to port 80 to our Web-server 192.168.0.2.
# We will allow any outgoing connections from network 192.168.1.0/24 to
# SMTP, POP3, FTP, DNS and unprivileged ports.
# Note, that redirect may also be used with proxy or portmapper. It will
# allow you to redirect requests to different ports or different server
# for different clients.

#  sharing access to internet

external 10.1.1.1
# external is address 3proxy uses for outgoing connections. 0.0.0.0 means any
# interface. Using 0.0.0.0 is not good because it allows to connect to 127.0.0.1

internal 192.168.1.1
# internal is address of interface proxy will listen for incoming requests
# 127.0.0.1 means only localhost will be able to use this proxy. This is
# address you should specify for clients as proxy IP.
# You MAY use 0.0.0.0 but you shouldn't, because it's a chance for you to
# have open proxy in your network in this case.

# dnsproxy listens on UDP/53 to answer client's DNS requests. It requires

# we can portmap port TCP/25 to provider's SMTP server and UDP/53
# to provider's DNS.
# Now we can use our proxy as SMTP and DNS server.
# -s switch for UDP means "single packet" service - instead of setting
# association for period of time association will only be set for 1 packet.
# It's very userfull for services like DNS but not for some massive services
# like multimedia streams or online games.
