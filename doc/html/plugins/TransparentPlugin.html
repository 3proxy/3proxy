<h3>3proxy TransparentPlugin plugin (Linux only)</h3>

Plugin can turn 3proxy into transparent proxy for virtually any TCP-based protocol
and use all 3proxy features - redirections, parent proxies, ACLs, traffic limitations,
etc. TransparentPlugin plugin takes destination IP:port from Linux and uses this
information as a target IP in proxy. An example of usage:

<pre>
plugin /path/to/TransparentPlugin.ld.so transparent_plugin
log /path/to/log
auth iponly
allow * * * 80
parent 1000 http 0.0.0.0 0
allow *
parent 1000 socks5 SOCKS5_IP SOCKS5_PORT USER PASSWORD
tcppm -iLOCAL_IP 12345 127.0.0.1 11111
</pre>
Now, any TCP traffic transparently redirected to port 12345 will be routed via
parent SOCKSv5 proxy and logged, all URLs for web requests are visible in logs.
Paremeters '127.0.0.1 11111' in this case are not used and are overwritten by
destination IP:port for each transparent connection.
