3proxy --install 
	
	installs and starts proxy as Windows service
	(config file should be located in the same directory)

3proxy --remove 

	removes the service (should be stopped before via
	'net stop 3proxy').

	To build in Linux install git and build-essentials packages, use

git clone https://github.com/z3apa3a/3proxy
cd 3proxy
ln -s Makefile.Linux Makefile
make
make install

	use /etc/3proxy/add3proxyuser.sh script to add users.


Please read doc/html/index.html and man pages.

	+ DNS proxy
	+ DNS over TCP support, redirecting DNS traffic via parent
	  proxy

  2. Proxy chaining and network connections
	+ Can be used as a bridge between client and different proxy type
	  (e.g. convert incoming HTTP proxy request from client to SOCKSv5
	  request to parent server).
	+ Connect back proxy support to bypass firewalls
	+ Parent proxy support for any type of incoming connection
	+ Username/password authentication for parent proxy(s).
	+ HTTPS/SOCKS4/SOCKS5 and ip/port redirection parent support

3proxy    	Combined proxy server may be used as
		executable or service (supports installation and removal).
		It uses config file to read it's configuration (see
		3proxy.cfg.sample for details).
		3proxy.exe is all-in-one, it doesn't require all others .exe
		to work.
		See 3proxy.cfg.sample for examples, see man 3proxy.cfg

proxy    	HTTP proxy server, binds to port 3128
ftppr    	FTP proxy server, binds to port 21
socks    	SOCKS 4/5 proxy server, binds to port 1080
ftppr		FTP proxy server, please do not mess it with FTP over HTTP
		proxy used in browsers
pop3p    	POP3 proxy server, binds to port 110. You must specify
		POP3 username as username@target.host.ip[:port]
		port is 110 by default.
		Exmple: in Username configuration for you e-mail reader
		set someuser@pop.somehost.ru, to obtains mail for someuser
		from pop.somehost.ru via proxy.
smtpp    	SMTP proxy server, binds to port 25. You must specify
		SMTP username as username@target.host.ip[:port]
		port is 25 by default.
		Exmple: in Username configuration for you e-mail reader
		set someuser@mail.somehost.ru, to send mail as someuser
		via mail.somehost.ru via proxy.
tcppm    	TCP port mapping. Maps some TCP port on local machine to
		TCP port on remote host.
udppm    	UDP port mapping. Maps some UDP port on local machine to
		UDP port on remote machine. Only one user simulationeously
		can use UDP mapping, so it cann't be used for public service
		in large networks. It's OK to use it to map to DNS server
		in small network or to map Counter-Strike server for single
		client (you can use few mappings on different ports for
		different clients in last case).
mycrypt    	Program to obtain crypted password fro cleartext. Supports
		both MD5/crypt and NT password.
			mycrypt password
		produces NT password
			mycrypt salt password
		produces MD5/crypt password with salt "salt".
dighosts    	Utility for building networks list from web page.


Run utility with --help option for command line reference.
